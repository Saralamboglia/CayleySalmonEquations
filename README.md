# Cayley-Salmon Equations
This repository contains all Macaulay2 codes and outputs for the paper "A short note on Cayley-Salmon Equations" M.H.Hahn,S.Lamboglia,A.Vargas

Note:
1-The file  Clebsch-Tritangent-CS.sage can be runned as "sage Clebsch-Tritangent-CS.sage"
2-The other files are Macaulay2 code:
*AuxiliaryFile-AnticanonicalEmbedding.m2 contains auxiliary materials to compute Cayley-Salmon equations for a cubic surface
*Code-AnticanonicalEmbedding contains all code to compute the 120 Cayley-Salmon equations as in Proposition 4.1 
*Code-ClassicalCSEq contains code to compute the Cayley-Salmon equations for the octanomial form in the paper "An octanomial model for cubic surfaces"
*File-with-lines.m2--This file contains the Plueker coordinates of the lines in the cubic surface associated to the octanomial in the paper "An octanomial model for cubic surfaces"
*Output-AnticanonicalEmbedding: contains all Cayley-Salmon equations computed using Proposition 4.1. in the form {{l1,l2,l3},{m1,m2,m3}}
